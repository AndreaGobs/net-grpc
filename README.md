# net-grpc

The solution provides intro gRPC application for .NET Core 5.0.

Xamarin project deosn't work.

## The future of gRPC in C#

[The future of gRPC in C#](https://grpc.io/blog/grpc-csharp-future):
- [Grpc.Net.Client](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Grpc.Net.Client)
- [Grpc.AspNetCore.Server](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Grpc.AspNetCore.Server)

## Protocol buffer

[Language guide - proto3](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto3)

### Request and response message

The **CalculateSize** function calculates the size of the message in Protocol Buffer wire format, in bytes.

Encoding and decoding is not so easy ([encoding](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/encoding)).

But for the message:
```
message HelloRequest {
  string name = 1;          // tag needs 1 byte when in range 1-15
  string surname = 2;       // tag needs 1 byte
  string address = 16;      // tag needs 2 bytes when in range 16-2047
}
```
when *name*='Console-1' and *surname*='abcdefg' and *address*='aaaa' the size is 27:
- 1 (tag) + 1 (name length)    + 9 (name)
- 1 (tag) + 1 (surname length) + 7 (surname)
- 2 (tag) + 1 (address length) + 4 (address)
where **tag** helds *key value* + *data type*

## gRPC performance improvements in .NET 5

[gRPC performance improvements in .NET 5](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/aspnet/grpc-performance-improvements-in-net-5)

## gRPCurl

Tooling is available for gRPC that allows developers to test services without building client apps ([doc](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/grpc/test-tools?view=aspnetcore-5.0)):
- **gRPCurl** is a command-line tool that provides interaction with gRPC services
- **gRPCui** builds on top of gRPCurl and adds an interactive web UI for gRPC, similar to tools such as Postman and Swagger UI

### Run gRPCui

When the gRPC server (supporting reflection) is running, run *grpcui* with the server address to interact with as an argument:
```
$ grpcui -plaintext localhost:50001
```
The tool launches a browser window with the interactive web UI. gRPC services are automatically discovered using gRPC reflection.
